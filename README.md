# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling within asynchronous database operations. The `bug.js` file shows an example route handler that neglects to properly handle potential errors during database interaction. This can lead to server crashes or unexpected responses to clients.  The solution demonstrates best practices for robust error management.

## Bug

The primary issue lies in the absence of comprehensive error handling within the database callback function. If `db.getUser()` encounters an error (e.g., database connection failure, invalid user ID), the application doesn't gracefully manage it. This can lead to unhandled promise rejections or even a complete application crash.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a corrected version of the route handler. It incorporates comprehensive error handling, including checking for null or undefined user objects and providing appropriate responses (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).  It also shows good practice for handling async operations.
